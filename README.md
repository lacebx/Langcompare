# 🧠 LangCompare

**LangCompare** is a clean, fast React + Vite app that compares how different programming languages handle common programming tasks — side by side.

## 🤔 Why I Made This

LangCompare is one of several projects I’m building to make up for my past academic mistakes. I didn’t give some of my CS classes — like Programming Languages — the energy or attention they deserved, and it reflected in my grades.

But failing a class doesn’t mean I don’t understand the material or can’t create something meaningful with it. This project is proof of that. LangCompare is me showing that I *do* get it — I just needed to approach it my own way.
